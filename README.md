## ðŸ§ª **Features of This Project**
- Load a dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`
- Split dataset into training and testing sets
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Compare their accuracy on the test set
- No need to upload any external CSV file
- Simple and fast execution for beginners

## âœ…**Conclusion**
## Decision Trees are simple and easy to interpret, but may overfit on small datasets.
## Random Forests are more powerful and accurate as they combine multiple trees and reduce overfitting.
## In this task, Random Forest gave better performance than a single Decision Tree.
## This project is a great starting point to learn tree-based machine learning models.
